This month saw Consentua Creators, KnowNow Information join the <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/kantara-initiative-releases-first-open-global-consent-receipt-specification/">Kantara Initiative. </a>

For over a year now the team at Consentua have been active participants in the evolution of the <em><a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/file-downloads/file-download-consent-receipt-recommendation-v1-0-r
eport/">Consent Receipt specification</a></em>. As an <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/infosharing/2+-+Consent+Receipt+Implementations">early adopter of the specification</a>, our team admired the work that Kantara perform in the wider identity and privacy space.

##Why should I care about consent receipts?

We should care about consent receipts because they are a very important foundation for a new discipline called Consent Management. This is new to the world of digital technology, as it consists of a mix of marketing, compliance, data lifecycle management, and business operations.

Where consent is the legal basis for processing personal data, being transparent and giving people appropriate controls is essential to complying with the law. The use of consent receipts,  building trust with the customer, are an integral part of providing that transparency and control.

Consent receipts give the owner clear notice as to what a user has agreed that their personal data may be used for. Once consent has been established, the consent receipt provides a representation of the data subject’s intent that can be stored, shared and queried.

The clarity and control provided by consent receipts opens up possibilities for awesome new digital services that make use of personal data, but at the same time respect the wishes and autonomy of data subjects.

##Interoperability
Enabling and accelerating the interchange of personal data to realise new value requires barriers to be dismantled. Embracing interoperability - of the kind that consent receipts provide - will prevent barriers being erected and help stop rejection of third-party receipts because they ‘were not made here’.

An early co-leadership responsibility that Consentua will therefore take, along with <a href="https://digi.me">Digi.me</a>, is developing interoperability of the consent receipt specification.

In the age of data portability and with customers demanding seamless machine driven exchanges of data, having an interoperable consent receipt will aid the user experience and increase the likelihood of industry-wide adoption. 

Colin Wallis, executive director of the Kantara Initiative stated: 
Consentua has always been part of the Kantara family. It’s just that it finally got round to making it formal. And for that, we are very happy!

##Kantara Initiative
The Consentua team is looking forward to working even more closely with the Kantara community to help evolve and collaborate on the foundation of consent management, the Consent Receipt!
