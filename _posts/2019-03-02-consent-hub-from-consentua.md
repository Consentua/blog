# The consent hubbub

## Creating a new dataset

Consent management is creating a new data set. One that is not actually owned by the business but is owned and managed by their customer. This dataset from a Consentua perspective follows a standard from Kantara and is the consent receipt. 
 
Yet, the business needs to access this consent receipt to check or trigger they are allowed to do what they need to do with regard to a customers personal data.

## A New Requirement is born

What is rapidly discovered is that multiple parties internal and sometimes externally all want to have access to this consent receipt. Now, the customer tends to have only one or two access points into an organisation (e.g. via an app or direct in store). 
 
However, the business needs many systems to deliver the smile the customer demands. All these systems use personal data. They will want to use this single golden record of consent. 
 
In the era of RESTful services and API’s the concept of sharing a common resource is easy to facilitate.  Thus the ‘consent hub’ is born. It will act as a common place for consent receipts and manage the access to the consent receipt from requesting parties/systems.  

## Consentua is a Consent Hub

I will admit we did not consider Consentua as a consent hub when we created the first version back in 2016. However, the capability of Consentua as a consent hub has been in place from day one.

## Consentua is a Consent Hub.
 
This is because the owner of the client consent service (the business requesting a customers consent), can allow any party to access the service to query their consent receipts.

Using webhooks and notifications it is possible to create automated triggers and workflows.  So when a customer changes their consent, the record is seamlessly updated elsewhere.
 
Consentua can manage via its admin dashboard the consent requests and consent services the business is using. Full control and flexibility of the consent service are at the client's control.
 
Supporting multi-language, multi-jurisdiction, multi-purposes and different consent scenarios (e.g. employees versus customers consent) all under a single consent management view.
