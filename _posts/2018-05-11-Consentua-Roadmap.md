## Now on Trello

Taking a leaf out of some [others books](https://trello.com/b/bnAC4rtd/pixelme-roadmap) (thank you Pixelme!) and in the interests of transparency the Consentua team is pleased to release in public the [Consentua Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/AktQXrOh/consentua-roadmap).  

We invite comments and votes for promoting changes on existing cards.   As well adding cards for new functions, enhancements that we can add to Consentua over time.

## How it works

The cards have been allocated a target build.   These are given obscure mammal names so we know which release we are working on.  

So far we have outlined plans for the next two releases.  These are Capybara and Dugong.  However, plans are always subject to change especially when driven by customer demands.

## Vote with your thumbs

The intention is to have the majority of future functional change driven by customer demand. This seems much better  than us sitting back at Consentua HQ thinking we know best.  Yes, sometimes we will be selfish and promote a change that benefits Consentua, but only because that change will benefit the majority in terms of improved performance, security, resilience and maybe sometimes function.  

To that end we ask our followers and users to help us prioritise the next functions and vote with your thumbs.   


## Understand the Key

We have colour coded the cards to give readers an understanding of where the change will impact and who it will benefit.   What is interesting here is that we are shifting from an engineering driven set of changes to more customer driven changes.   May that long continue! 

The key breaks down into different elements:  API, Dashboard, SDK from a purely compoent impact aspect.  Next is customer requested, easier management (for Consentua that is) and client centric function which is focused on identifying who the improving function will benefit.
