## Consentua takes important step towards open personal data ecosystems with MyData

Today, we are celebrating Consentua’s involvement in MyData Global’s recently published paper, Understanding MyData Operators. It is a foundational step on a roadmap towards a human centric personal data infrastructure that involved 34 experts and was supported by 48 personal data operators in 15 countries. The MyData vision published in 2015, describes operators as actors in personal data ecosystems that provide infrastructure for human-centric personal data management and governance. Consentua is one such organisation and prides itself on its contribution to the creation of sustainable ecosystems where the use of data is transparent and controlled by individuals. As providers of infrastructure for personal data management, we recognise our responsibility in creating sustainable ecosystems for fair and ethical use of personal data. 

The need for a human-centric data economy is evident: fighting and understanding the impact of COVID19 in a privacy-preserving way, and creating better public and private services are just some of the examples. The paper creates a common language, leading to a better understanding of the field and the roles different actors can take. From there, it defines minimum interoperability requirements and emphasises the need for governance. 

Richard Gomer, product lead for Consentua said “The report shows how the MyData principles are being put into practice through real-life tools and products, including Consentua. We've been working with MyData for a number of years and are so pleased to have been able to contribute to this report. 

> The future of personal data is one in which individuals have choice and control over how their data is used.”

“We are really proud that MyData Global has facilitated this landmark paper”, says Teemu Ropponen, general manager of MyData Global. “Operator organisations worldwide have joined on a common journey towards interoperable infrastructure for using personal data across digital services. These operators commit to working in a way that not only puts the rights of the individual in the centre, but also sets them on a collective path to build ecosystems that work for people. The MyData operator philosophy is very much aligned with the recently published EU data strategy, which emphasises the rights of individuals in these developing infrastructures.”

From here on, we will continue to help the MyData Operators Thematic Group in keeping the operators network connected, contributing to thought leadership and working towards interoperability, both in technology, governance as well as human-centric business models.
