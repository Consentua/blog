## I need a way to manage consent to meet GDPR.
The easiest way to manage consent is to deploy a tool which simply records and helps you to manage your consent requirements and your customer’s consent decisions. Consentua is one such tool, a lightweight low impact API. It gives users choice and control over what happens to their personal data.

You can also consider a more complex, feature rich Personal Information Manager that will own your and your customer’s personal data interactions. This tool would become your golden record of identity. It would capture and manage consent for that users identity.

## Bonus Benefits for using Consentua:

## Conclusion

The easiest way for 99% of organisations to quickly control the management of consent under GDPR is to use a purpose built consent manager such as Consentua. It is a flexible, secure and lightweight API solution. It encourages trust and improved customer service.

Deploying a whole PIM suite may be the right thing to do for some organisations but it is likely to be a more complex process for a less flexible long term solution. The reliance on using your user’s personal data also means there is risk of unauthorised access.

Consentua helps a DPO manage a single point of entry into your organisation to see who has consented to what. It helps your marketing team get closer to, and know more about, your cutstomers. It provides choice and control.
